- As a researcher I want to see temperature by time and by region.
- Users can select a time range (e.g., past 24 hours, last 7 days).
- Users can select a region from a map or dropdown.
- The app displays a time-series chart of temperature for the selected region.
- Data updates correctly when filters are changed
