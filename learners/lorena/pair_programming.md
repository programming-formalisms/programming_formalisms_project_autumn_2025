- What is pair programming? 

Two people write code together on one machine. It is a very collaborative way of working and involves a lot of communication. 


- How does a good pair behave? Describe what can be observed when pairing online 

One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, they do not only write code, they also plan and discuss their work. 

 
 -There are indicators that a pair is not performing well: 

Disengagement may present as one of the members physically withdraws away from the keyboard, accesses email, or even falls asleep. 

The "Watch the Master" phenomenon can arise if one member is more experienced than the other. In this situation, the junior member may take the observer role, deferring to the senior member of the pair for the majority of coding activity. This can easily lead to disengagement. 


- When to switch roles? Give a procedure 

Frequently, when energy goes down consider switching 

 
- What effects does pair programming have? 

Faster coding (not in man power), more confidence in code, less bugs (Code review on-the-go), learn communication skills, look outside the box, Knowledge Sharing, Reflection: "Saying and explaining things out loud pushes us to reflect if we really have the right understanding", Keeping focus, different perspectives, Collective Code Ownership, Fast onboarding of new team members 


**But**

Pairing can be exhausting 

requires empathy and interpersonal skills 

Interruptions by meetings (fit into schedule of two people)
